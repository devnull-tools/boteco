= Boteco REST API

This module contains a REST API that allows external communication. Once this bundle is started, you can access
a set of paths:

GET cxf/boteco/message/channels:: returns a list of currently available channels
POST cxf/boteco/message/{{channel}}:: allows to send a message to a target through the given channel

The payload for sending a message is a JSON with the following properties:

content:: the content of the message
target:: the target of the message

If the response code is 200, the message will be delivered soon, if the response is 202, the message will be
delivered as soon as the channel goes online.
