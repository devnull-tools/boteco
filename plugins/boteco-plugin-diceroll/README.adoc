= DiceRoll Plugin

This is a simple plugin for rolling dices. It exposes the `roll` command, which accepts a list of dices in the
pattern `n`d`s`, where:

- `n`: number of dices
- `s`: number of sides (valid ones: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 20)

To concat more dices, use the `+` operator. You can also add a bonus by using a number without the `d`.

Example:

[source]
----
<prefix> roll 2d6 + d8 + 2
----

This will roll two d6's plus one d8 and add a bonus of 2.
