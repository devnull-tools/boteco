= Karma Plugin

This is a simple karma plugin. It will parse any (++/--) terms that arrives in channels and computes the
karma.

This plugin requires a repository implementation (check `boteco-plugin-karma-repository` bundle for the default
implementation).

== Querying ranks

There is a command `rank` that allows queries to the karma database. The options are:

- Query for a specific term by using the term as is
- Query for a _like_ term by using `*` as wildcard
- Reverse order by using the prefix `!` (can be combined with the other options)
