= Karma Plugin

This is a simple karma plugin. It will parse any (++/--) terms that arrives in channels and computes the
karma.

This plugin uses a MongoDB Database to store the karmas outside the JVM so make sure you have a MongoDB instance
running and make sure you have configured the `boteco-plugin-mongodb`.
