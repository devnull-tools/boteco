= Karma Plugin

This is a simple karma plugin. It will parse any (++/--) terms that arrives in channels and computes the
karma.

This plugin uses a MongoDB Database to store the karmas outside the JVM so make sure you have a MongoDB instance
running and make sure you have configured the `boteco-plugin-mongodb`.

== Configuration

You can configure the karma expressions by creating a config named `tools.devnull.boteco.plugins.karma` with the
following key patterns:

${key}.karma:: the value of this property will be used instead of the word karma
${key}.term:: the value of this property will be used instead of the karma term
