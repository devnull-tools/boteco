= Karma Repository Plugin

This is a bundle that contains the repository implementation for the Karma Plugin. This plugin uses a MongoDB Collection
to store the karmas outside the JVM so make sure you have a MongoDB instance running and make sure you have configured
the `boteco-plugin-mongodb` bundle.
