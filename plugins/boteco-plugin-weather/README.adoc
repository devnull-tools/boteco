= Weather Plugin

This is a plugin that queries weathers based on the `weather` command. This plugin requires a searcher service to
function (see `boteco-plugin-weather-searcher` for a default implementation).

For example, if you send the message `boteco weather QUERY`, boteco will show results for the given query in the
channel.
